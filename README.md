Puzzle Hack project created for **Flutter Puzzle Hack** by Very Good CLI.

---

## Inspiration ðŸš€

Work in this hackathon has been a challenge for me. I had the puzzle idea in my mind a lot of time ago, and this was a great opportunity to do it.

I took the VGV project as reference, but I created my own project from scratch using Very Good CLI tool.

I had in mind to investigate some tools and this challenge was perfect for it:

- Drag & Drop
- Voice Commands

## Implementation

The first thing that I wanted to do in a different way was the movement of the pieces, therefore I investigated how to work with Drag & Drop (https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/drag-a-widget).

One thing that I had really clear was the status management. I always work and I love flutter_bloc (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) , so... why to change it now?

To work with user management I use Firebase, was my first time using flutterfire cli (https://firebase.flutter.dev/) and I need to say that it's a wonderful tool.

Finally I had the opportunity to work with command voices. To develop it I used the speech_to_text package (https://pub.dev/packages/speech_to_text), that is really easy to use.

## To do in the future

The first thing that I have in my TODO list is to improve the project with more tests.

Another thing is to add more platforms (linux and windows). At this moment is not possible because firebase libraries are not working for those platforms.

I also want to add the possibility to move the pieces with the keyboard and use some kind of animations.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed developing this challenge like a baby and I learn a lot of things :)
